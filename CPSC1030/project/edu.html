 <p>I did my schooling from MR Citi SEN SEC Public School, Balachaur, Punjab, India which is affiliated to Central Board of Secondary Edcuation, India. It is the first ranked school of my area. I joined this school in 1st class and studied there till 12th. I was one of the marvellous students of that school. The staff of that school was very well-qualified and experienced. I love my school very much and miss those school days when all the students of our class had fun and participated in different competitions. I am sharing the video of my school below. After senior secondary, I planned to study in Canada and I performed in IELTS and got 7 bands and started looking for a best college and In that time as I was never interested in remaining free I took admisssion in BSC Non-Med in Punjab University, Chandigarh and due to Covid the immigration proess was very slow. So, I was waiting for everything to become normal and then I got married to Rashwinder Kumar. I continued my BSc and completed 4 semester and at that time, I applied for my study in Langara College and leaved BSc as it and now I am pursuing Diploma in Computer Studies in Langara College. I like this college very much as the staff is quite experienced and supportive. </p>

Program development skills including: analyzing a problem to make it amenable to programming; writing structured, modularized programs; program documentation; interacting with the computer operating system; event driven programming for client-side web applications. I feel this course to be a bit difficult because I do not have any programming experience before and Javascipt is complelety new for me. But I am trying my best to get good understanding of this course and even my instructor is also helping me very much by clearing all my doubts. </p>
