  <p>The best pastime for me is talking to my family members especially my husband and my mother .When I was in India, I used to sit with my whole family and talk about different topics and this was the most precious time for me . Now, I am not with my family and I am missing this moment very much. Moreover, I have some other hobbies too which are as follows:
  <dl>
   <dt>Listening Music</dt>
   <dd> I like to listen music especially punjabi songs as punjabi is my mother-tonque. It is quite shocking that before coming to Canada,I never listened to music. I just play songs while dancing but now, wherever I go, whatever I do, the songs are playing in the background as this is I think a way to keep stress and depression away from mind. I like to listen motivational songs the most.But my favourite song that is the first song in punjabi language that I am listening since 10th standard is one that I am sharing below.

   <dt>Yoga and Meditation </dt>
   <dd>I like to execise so as to keep myself healthy and fit. Mediataion keeps our mind healthy ans fresh.I usually do it for 1 hour a day or whenever I feel stressed. Moreover, I love trying to do different yoga asanas.</dd>
   <dt>Playing different games </dt>
   <dd>I like to play different games escpecially indoor games like chess, Carrom board, ludo and manymore. Since my childhood, I used to play Carromboard with my brother and cousins. </dd>
