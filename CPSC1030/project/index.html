  <p>My name is Simran. I am 20 years old. I am from India and currently I am staying in canada to study computer science. I did my schooling from CBSE India and now, I am pursuing my studies in Langara College to achieve my goal. My program is Diploma in Computer Studies.Its my first semester in college and I came to canada on 22nd December,2021. </p>
  <p>My strength is my family who supports me in every situation and for me my family is most important. Moreover, I am honest ,hardworking ,dedicated to my work and study and I am self-motivated. I am an introvert and do not have many friends as I cann't trust anyone very easily and I hesitate to talk to anybody. My best friends are my mother and my husband who are indeed my life. The toughest thing that I feel being an international student here in Canada is living without family and I often feel homesickness and depressed without my family and like to talk to my family members in my free time and this is thing that I like the most.</p>
  <p>I live in a joint family in which I have my parents-in-law, brother-in-law,her wife and a cute little daughter, my husband and myself. I am from Nawanshahr ,Punjab ,India. I feel it to be the best thing of life to be a part of such a beatiful family. Before marriage, I live with my parents and a younger brother. Whatever I am today is all because of my parents and I can never forget their struggles that they did in life to provide best things to me.</p>
