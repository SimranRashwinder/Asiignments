  <p>I love to volunteer for different tasks since my childhood. As per my belief, voluteering is good for the wellbeing of our society, voluteering for things or works that are for the betterment of society allows us to become a good citizen of the country. Also, volunteering for different tasks at different places gives us knowledge about variety of things that one might not get from other sources and it also helps to build connections between people. A person who works for the betterment of others always have a hope that others will also help them whenever they need. For me, helping others is like an oppurtunity to know different things and make best out of those things and by helping others I feel positive and energetic. I am also sharing few moments when I volunteered for different tasks in my school below:  </p>

  This is a picture of the rally in which I participated and it was to make public aware about the hazards of environmental pollution especially that is caused by plastic. As in India, most of the people use plastic bags, bottles and other things made of low quality plastic which causes pollution.<br>
