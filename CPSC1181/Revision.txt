Whatever is defined in the class body the scope is whole class between the{}but if it is defined in a method then te scope is just that method
BA b1  = new BA();
BA b2 = new SA();
b2.deposit(); //deposit of BA will be called

b2 = new CA();
b2.deposit(); //depoit of CA will be called
b2.deductFees(); //this will not be called bcz deduct fees is not in BA so we will have to 

both method and instance variable can be static
For class A
private static int s = 0;
private int n;
if in main new object A is created there will be a space reserved for n but s will have only 1 value for all the objects of type A
#don't use static if it is not necessary;
don't define static var in constructor;

ABSTARCT CLASS_ Rgular class with diff instance var, methods, const, abstract method(can not have method body)
but it can not be intanciated like we can not say c1 = new Card(); if class Card is abstract


if a class inherits abstract class then it will have to override the abstract method(that's forced)
but the only exception from this is when the child class is also abstract.
